# Go HTTP Digest Authentication

## Overview

This is package based on the (currently unmantained) [digest](https://github.com/bobziuchkovski/digest) package.
I coded this new approach to cover my use case, the monero-wallet-rpc digest authentication.
For now, it only supports auth qop, MD5.

## Usage

See the [godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/gabstv/httpdigest) for details.

## License
